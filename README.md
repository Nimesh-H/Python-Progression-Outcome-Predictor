# Python-Progression-Outcome-Predictor

Student Version
The program allows students to predict their progression outcome at the end of each academic year. 
The program prompts for the number of credits at pass, defer and fail and then display the appropriate progression outcome for an individual student. 
The program let the user know if credits are not in the range 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120. I.e., ‘Range error’ is displayed. 
The program should let the user know if the total of the pass, defer and fail credits is not 120. I.e., ‘Total incorrect’ is displayed.

Staff Version

The program prompt for credits at pass, defer and fail and display the appropriate progression for each individual student until the staff member user enters ‘q’ to quit. 
When ‘q’ is entered, the program produces a ‘histogram’ where each star represents a student who achieved a progress outcome in the category range: progress, trailing, module retriever and exclude. 
The program should display the number of students for each progression category and the total number of outcomes processed.
